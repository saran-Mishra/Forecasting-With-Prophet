# Forecasting-Kaggle-Competition

Wanted to utilize Meta's Prophet (https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) for time-series forecasting. Neither Prophet multiplicative nor additive model performs very well on this type of data. But got a chance to work with tabular time-series data. Random Forest Regressor model perfomed the best and beat the prophet model. I assume that is because of the structure of the data. It was easy to see the non-linearities of the dataset during EDA. Stationarity and Seasonality are heavily explored in the notebook. 

# Next steps
1) Ridge regression as per https://www.kaggle.com/code/ivyzang/1st-place-solution-less-is-more
2) CatBoost
3) TFT
